Linear Regression Implementation in Python using NumPy/Pandas
@author Saad Moro

This respository contains Python code to implement linear regression using the NumPy and Pandas libraries. Running part1.py performs linear regression using batch gradient descent, plots results with matplotlib and creates a table of important features. Part 1 uses normalized data. part2.py performs the same, but does not use normalized data. The required training and validation data is contained in this repository as well.
